# Cataract Detection using ZFNet

This project aims to detect cataracts in eye images using ZFNet, a convolutional neural network architecture, implemented in Python with the TensorFlow framework.

## Introduction

Cataract is a common eye condition characterized by clouding of the lens, which leads to impaired vision and can eventually cause blindness if left untreated. Early detection of cataracts is crucial for timely treatment and prevention of vision loss.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown remarkable performance in various image recognition tasks, including medical image analysis. ZFNet, a variant of CNN, has been successfully used in image classification tasks and can be adapted for cataract detection.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- OpenCV (for image preprocessing)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Dataset of eye images (with annotations if available)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cataract-detection-zfnet.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Preprocess the dataset:
   - Organize your dataset into training and testing sets.
   - If necessary, preprocess the images (e.g., resizing, normalization, augmentation).
   
2. Train the ZFNet model:
   ```
   python train.py --dataset path_to_dataset --epochs num_epochs --batch_size batch_size
   ```

3. Evaluate the trained model:
   ```
   python evaluate.py --dataset path_to_test_dataset --model path_to_trained_model
   ```

4. Make predictions on new images:
   ```
   python predict.py --image path_to_image --model path_to_trained_model
   ```

## Dataset

Ensure that you have a dataset of eye images containing both cataract and normal images. If annotations (labels) are available indicating which images contain cataracts, it will be helpful for training the model.

## Model

ZFNet is a convolutional neural network architecture that was introduced as a variant of AlexNet. It consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers and fully connected layers. The model has shown promising results in image classification tasks.

## Results

Include any relevant results or performance metrics obtained from training and evaluating the model on your dataset.
