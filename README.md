# Cataract Detection using ZFNet

This project aims to detect cataracts in eye images using ZFNet, a convolutional neural network architecture, implemented in Python with the TensorFlow framework.

## Introduction

Cataract is a common eye condition characterized by clouding of the lens, which leads to impaired vision and can eventually cause blindness if left untreated. Early detection of cataracts is crucial for timely treatment and prevention of vision loss.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown remarkable performance in various image recognition tasks, including medical image analysis. ZFNet, a variant of CNN, has been successfully used in image classification tasks and can be adapted for cataract detection.

## Requirements
